# WebProject
Dynamic Website for Medicine Search Assistance
In this project, we created a website to make it easier to search for medicines and to improve the relationship and communication between patients and pharmacies (pharmacists). We followed a clear process of analysis and design, starting with the identification of functional and non-functional requirements for the future users of our site. Then, we used the UML modeling language to represent the main parts of the system with different types of diagrams.

For the development of our website, we used several tools and languages such as WampServer, MySQL database, CSS3 style sheets, JavaScript, and PHP. We believe that this website is both practical and efficient, and that it can replace many of the traditional solutions that exist today.
